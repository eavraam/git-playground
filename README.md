## Welcome to Git!

Lots of fun stuff going on here.

- Initialization, tracking files and making commits.
- Branching and checking out properly.
- Pull requests.
- Merging and resolving merge conflicts (both manually and by using Visual Studio Code's interface).

Some more "spicy" topics in order to properly move back to a previous commit, or save the under-development work while some urgent bug needs to be fixed in the same branch.

- git reset (soft, mixed and hard).
- git stash
